# NX Provisioner

Quickly provision a modded switch with the newest bootloader, CFW, applications, and payloads. For a list of everything that is downloaded, see the [Projects](#Projects) section below.

Check the GitHub Actions page artifact for releases I have tested.

<br>

## Quickstart
```
$ pip install requests bs4
$ python3 nx-provisioner.py
```

Open `drag-n-drop` directory and drag all of the contents to the Switch microSD card.
